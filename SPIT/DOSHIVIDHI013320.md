# Project Name
Health-Care Management using Blockchain

## Description
THe medical records system followed by doctors right now is totally offline and based on prescriptions written on papers. But synchronizing and keeping these patients health records becomes almost impractical and this is where blockchain is used. The webapp intends to keep medical records and provide integrity, availability and confidentiality.

## Functions
1. Open Identity system for Decentralized web using Uport.
2. Smart contracts that maintain two types of nodes: namely Patient and Doctor
3. A symptom checker which shows the possible diseases using which presciptions can be given to a patient.

## Technology stack / technology used ( Very Detailed )

Front-end: React - Truffle Box react-uport - Used for easy implementation of Uport, Also, React is used for the same reason too<br> 
Pure CSS was used along with React for styling.<br>
Uport was used to provide open accountability system.<br>
Back-end: Solidity - Smart Contratcs - For Blockchain for storing records<br>
BlockChain: Ethereum (XDC was used earlier but couldn't be used further due to migration error)
<br>
## Limitations
The front-end is setup and the smart contracts have been made but web3.js integration couldn't be implemented.
## Future Aspects
1. There are many patients who show duplicate presciptions to pharmacist to get drugs. This can be prevented in blockchain where the pharmacist first checks for the authenticity of the prescription by verifying the same with the doctor.

2. Instead of giving ethers to miners, they can be given virtual coins which when reaches a particular amount, miner can be awarded with a free consultancy check-up or an extended insuarance month and some other options among which the user can decide. In case of doctors, it can be used a measure of rating which gives the doctor visibility among other doctors.

3. More nodes can be added. i)Pathology labs ii)Pharmacists iii)Physicians iv)Insuarance companies

4. The whole medicine world can communicate on the DApp and the lags that are faced right now can be spared.

      The doctor asks to do some reports, the reports once out must be shown to the doctor again and then the presciption given by the doctor is to be taken to the pharmacist to get drugs.This a really time taking process.
      Time wasted thus can be saved and even authenticated for security purposes.
      The lab reports once out can be added to the blockchain itself and notification of the same can be given to the doctor and the patient. The doctor can then check the report and add the prescription to the blockchain which will then be used by the pharmacist to verify. 

5. Verification of a person's death certificate.
