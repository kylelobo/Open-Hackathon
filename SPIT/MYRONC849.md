> # Project Name : FarmaChain

> ## Description :

_Food supply chains in most developing nations are inefficient due to information asymmetry. This directly results in low farmer income as farmers do not receive their due share, even though they are the most important part of the chain (the food producers)_

_FramaChain provides a Blockchain based WebPlatform for farmers and producers to get directly in contact with retailers/consumers via a secured,transparent Auction; uprooting the need for middleman. Hence, settling the deal on a decent Price for both the ends_.

> ## Functions

_1)Providing a safe and secure auction platform ensuring maximum benefits for farmers_

_2)Dummy metamask account transactions for sellers and buyers_

_3)Currency Conversion calculator for end user._

_4)Time scheduler to represent the validity of specified auction._

_5)Convenient steps for using the platform for new users._

## Technology stack / technology used ( Very Detailed )

_Client (Web3.js : HTML/CSS/Javascript)  
Solidity (Creation of smart contract)  
React.js (for Front End Development)  
Ethereum virtual machine Blockchain (for testing)  
Metamask (testing, using dummy ethers as currency)_

---

> ## Limitations

1.Farmers need to make initial efforts to become comfortable with the idea of cryptocurrency and metamask accounts.  
2.Inconvenience for the farmer to use his ethers once owned.

---

> ## Future Aspects

_1)Farmers can suspend the auctions after the specified interval of time_

_2)Auction must remain open until some bid is raised_

_3)Farmer can change the initial selling limit_

_4)Sellers will be provided with recommendation for selling limit_
