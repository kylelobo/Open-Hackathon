# Project Name
SafeMeds

## Description
Our Aim: To make use of blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform that enables
secure, fast and transparent exchange and usage of medical data from a user-focused
electronic health record whilst maintaining a single true version of the user’s data.

## Functions
-Stores medical records of patients in the blockchain
-Record of patients is secured until they share their Public Address with the doctor
-Smart Login, just click login and you will be logged in automatically. We achieve this by taking your public IP from metamask and querying it to the blockchain to log you in automatically

## Technology stack / technology used ( Very Detailed )
Solidity - We use Solidty to make Smart Contracts for the Ethereum network. Smart contracts are used to store patients and doctors information on the blockchain.  

Vue.js - Vue.js is used to make, interactive, beautiful and seemless frontend to interact with the the smart contact and show the data from the blockchain. 

Vuetify - Was used to make development with Vue easier. Vuetify provides state of the art ready made compenents for easy and fast integration of UI. 

Web3 - Web3 was used to communicate with out deployed contract in our Javascript code. 

Node - We used nodejs to create custom scripts to compile and deploy our smart contract to the blockchain. 

## Limitations
-The Blockchain concept is not widespread yet and there are only a few successful initiatives based on this modern technology at this time. That is a major hurdle because we don’t have many successful blockchain models to follow which creates an uncertain situation.
-The cost of establishing and maintaining a healthcare blockchain is unknown yet and no one can seriously consider this technology without knowing about its expenses ahead of time.
-Blockchain within the healthcare industry will be comprised of medical records, images, documents and lab reports which require a significant amount of storage space. Conceptually, every member included in the chain would have a complete copy of the full medical record of every individual in the U.S. and this volume could potentially exceed the storage capacity of current blockchain technology.

## Future Aspects
-As blockchain applications get more and more mainstream, the use of blockchain in health care sector becomes more valuable. With data breaches occurring in every corner of the global marketplace, data privacy has never been more important in healthcare. When blockchain is more universally accepted across healthcare organizations around the world, industry stakeholders will utilize an automatic program interface (API) to access a unique hash for each created PHI block and its associated patient identification. This keeps information related to identity private, while seamlessly granting access as needed.
