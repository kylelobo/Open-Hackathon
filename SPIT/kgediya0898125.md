# Project Name
# Certi-O-Chain ðŸ‘¾
## Description
In todayâ€™s world there are people who can easily with just some clicks can get
any certificate they want and with the desired grades. These hackers break in to the
system and modify things in his/her favor. So there is a definite need to put a stop to
this disaster, whatâ€™s the solution? You may ask. The answer is Blockchain. Using
Blockchain we can avoid this problem. In simple terms, a Blockchain can be
described as an append-only transaction ledger. What that means is that the ledger
can be written onto with new information, but the previous information, stored in
blocks, cannot be edited, adjusted or changed. This is accomplished by using
cryptography to link the contents of the newly added block with each block before
it, such that any change to the contents of a previous block in the chain would
invalidate the data in all blocks after it.

What does it do?
1. Blockchain keeps a record of all data exchanges.
2. It utilizes a distributed system to verify each transaction.
3. Once signed and verified, the new transaction is added to the blockchain
and can not be altered.

So, how does Certi-O-Chain make use of this amazing technology? The
certificate data from our website is stored on the block-chain nodes then it is deployed
onto the Blockchain network, here the data is immutable and is secure. Whenever
someone or a company wants to validate if the certificate and data associated with it
is legitimate they just need to enter the key id of the certificate on our website and
all the associated data with that certificate will be provided. What if an hacker
breaks into our website? Then there is no need to worry because even if our node is
effected by the hacker our data is distributed over the Blockchain network; so even
if one or more nodes are corrupted then it will not affect the data. If any changes are
detected then we just load the longest valid chain.
## Setup 
1. Run python node_server.py
2. Run python run_app.py
3. Use ngrok to host it publicly
Append this to your ngrok config file:
tunnels: <br>
  first:<br>
    addr: 5000<br>
    proto: http   <br> 
  second:<br>
    addr: 8000<br>
    proto: http <br>
 4. start localhost:5000 and press on request mining to start auto-mining

## Functions ðŸ› 
1. Decentralized Certification
2. One Click Certificate Validation 
3. Provides a network in which Multiple peers can connect.
4. Security.

## Technology stack / technology used ( Very Detailed ) ðŸ§¬
### Langugages:
1. Python : It is used as a core-backend language here along with flask to create a peer to peer connected block-chain.
The Whole block-chain is built upon python and then using flask and ngrok, a publicly accessible version is formed.

2. HTML/CSS : Front end is built using HTML & CSS 

### Frameworks:
1. Flask : Flask is a Python web framework.Flask can be used for building complex , database-driven websites,starting with mostly static pages. Flask is a micro-framework for Python. It allows you to build websites and web apps quite rapidly and easily, it's really good and light. We have utilised the features of this framework to power our Dapp

### Libraries: 
1. pdfkit : For converting html data to pdf for certificate creation
2. binascii : Used for Hexing certificate pdf for validation
3. requests : Requests allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 requests, without the need for manual labor
4. ngrok : Used for publicly hosting local host environment

## Limitations
As the certification data is stored on block-chain, and thus immutable,it is nearly impossible to change any mistakes while issuing 
certificates
## Future Aspects
The current version simulates a peer to peer connected public chain decentralized app.
fundamentals of the blockchain are illustrated here, and there are a lot of innovations currently happening in the field. There are different mining algorithms (like Proof Of Stake) and their variations. There are different consensus techniques too. There are permissioned blockchains other than Public blockchains. There are different ways of storing data in the chain. And there are different kind of data that different applications store in the blockchain. There are technologies like ethereum that allow even code to be run in a distributed fashion (aka Smart Contracts). All these innovations form grounds for different Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies that you'll see around you. But the fundamentals are more or less the same. So there's a lot more to explore!
