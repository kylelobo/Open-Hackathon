## PROBLEM STATEMENTS :

* Certification using Blockchain
Right now there are “n” number of ways to create a duplicate certificate online, available at the click of your mouse on the internet. Not only does it reduce the significance of a certificate but it also becomes impossible to verify authenticity of the certificate if one is presented.
The aim is to build a decentralized application which by using Smart contracts can create an immutable version of a document which can be verified by concerned parties.


* Pick any problem you see in your daily life & figure out how blockchain fits into it and why that problem should be addressed by blockchain. Give a solution using only blockchain or using blockchain in conjunction with any other technology of your choice.


* Blockchain industry is yet to be utilised at the max and we see new use-cases emerging daily. How according to you can tokenisation improve traditional way of doing business? You can use XinFin’s MyContract’s API to create a token for free.


* Healthcare
Make a blockchain based solution to address any issues in the current Healthcare system.
For e.g. : Right now there is not an efficient & secure system to maintain patient’s health records, prescriptions are handed out in paper which can be easily forged. There is no system which accumulates all the medical records of a person in a secure manner & gives complete history of a patient’s medical record.


* Change Proof of Work (PoW) Consensus in blockchain: Too much energy consumption makes PoW consensus non practical and not suitable for real world system. We need to find out other innovative consensus where transaction and network remains de-centralised but without much energy consumption. Research is being done in such consensus like DPOS ( delegated proof of stake ). Propose & implement such a consensus.
