PROJECT NAME : 
XINFIN REAL ESTATE


DESCRIPTION : 

We are creating a blockchain based distributed application using smart contracts for real estate buying and selling.


Why do we need a blockchain based application in the first place?
    • Real estate markets are not as efficient or organised, with an incredibly slow transaction time, and a less efficient price discovery mechanism.As a result, a lot of capital is trapped in certain geographic regions.
    • That is, if a person in a developed area wants to invest in a developing area, then the process for doing this is extremely difficult and time consuming as of today.
    • A land owner in a rural area will first contact a local broker who will then contact other brokers in different areas. These brokers will then be approached by interested buyers. 
    • All this will take significant time and the brokers will also charge a substantial fee of their own.

Solution : Using the blockchain for the real estate
    • It could revolutionalise the way the real estate industry works as of today
    • We could buy and sell property from our houses, that too, without any external interference and with a lot of security
    • Since the ledger will be decentralised, it will be practically impossible for anyone to steal any property or commit any fraud.
    • As we are using the hybrid blockchain technology provided by the xdc nodes, we will be able to decide which transactions are public and which transactions are private, as per our wish
    • In the beginning, sellers can upload their advertisements for everyone to see and once the property is sold, the buyer will be the owner of the propery in the blockchain
    • Then, as this method of transaction becomes popular, the jurisdictions will have to adopt the ledger as the legal ledger
    • An online document will be issued and the transactions will be forever encoded in the blockchain.









Why blockchain ?

The following advantages can be obtained 
    • Blockchain integration
        ◦ Your data is secure and your title deed is stored forever via the blockchain
    • Payment Channel
        ◦ Buy property online from any country using the xdc crypto currency
    • Paperwork Online
        ◦ Make offers, upload related documents, and get a confirmation online




Functions : 
    • Upload an advertisement
        ◦ The seller uploads his property as a classified advertisement
        ◦ The seller has to upload the images of the property as well as and the property name and description
        ◦ He also has to enter the Aadhar card number for verification
    • An interested buyer can buy the same using the xdc cryptocurrencies
    • Remove an advertisement
        ◦ If the property has been sold then, or if the seller decides to not to sell his property then the advertisement is taken off.



Use Cases : 

    • The application should be used to enable people to advertise, sell and buy properties online
    • As the number of transactions continue to increase, the application can also be used to check up the owner of a particular property










Technology stack




On the front end we use html and css for styling and java script for the coding part.PHP is used to create a database

Smart contracts are implemented using truffle suite as it makes the process a lot easier.There will be three types of contracts : 
    1. Metadata contract for storing the property documents
    2. Transaction contract will verify buyer and seller’s balance and authenticity
    3. Identity contract will verify the Aadhar number


Finally, the smart contract will be uploaded on the xdc blockchain













Limitations :


    • Cryptocurrencies which are used for transactions are extremely volatile which discourages people from investing in  cryptocurrencies like xdc
    • Crime : People buy and sell properties online and this may encourage criminals to buy property through online channels
    • People who are not tech savvy may choose to not to buy properties through a digital channel, using cryptocurrencies
    • People may try to sell properties which do not belong to them.


Future aspects : 

Basically since we are dealing with ‘properties’, they need not be just land related.This platform can be slightly modified to enable people to sell many different properties like :
    • Collectable items(Including artefacts and precious stones or metals)
    • Cars 
    • Shares
