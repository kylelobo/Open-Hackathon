# Open Hackathon

## VISION

To innovate and replace existing non-efficient closed systems with more transparent, efficient system using XinFin blockchain.

## NOTES
Participants are given complete freedom for choosing technology, programming languages etc. in the development of the application.

## Submission Guidelines
 [Submission Guidelines](./SubmissionGuide).

## Open Problem Statements

Below we have listed the problem statements which are open to all. In order to participate, create a proposal in the format specified & make a pull request.

## Problem Statement 1: Optimize delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus

In DPoS, Restriction numbers of node make its more centralized while large number of nodes makes the system very slow.
We are proposing Optimization in DPoS consensus. XinFin DPoS Development progress detail at: https://xinfin.org/dpos_tech_brief.php

## Problem Statement 2: Cross Blockchain Interoperability of XinFin Network with R3 Corda Network

As a R3 Corda Partner XinFin going to provide bridge to access public state on XinFin Blockchain to R3 consortium of over 200+ financial institutions. We need to Create Bridge between XinFin Network and R3 Corda. This will create the ability to relay R3 Corda a limited set of data and transactions from privacy channels to the XinFin public network.

### At the time of development of bridge keep below mentioned Standard:
a. [ISO20022 Data Standard](https://www.iso20022.org/sites/default/files/documents/general/ISO20022_API_JSON_Whitepaper_Final_20180129.pdf).

### Corda-XinFin Bridge Functionality

The Relayer Bridge deploys [ Corda Smart ContractState](https://docs.corda.net/api-states.html#api-states) â€”>[Onto]-> XinFin Network Smart Contract State (ContractInstance)

Functionalities are:
- Contract Creation (with function support "isBurnable", "isUpgradeable", "isPausable") and create Transaction Hash
- Atomic Swap (Include Hash of the transaction)
- ContractStatus, Token Transfer Events and Event Logs
- Hide Transactions Details (Needs Pre-compiled contract on EVM)

## Problem Statement 3 : XDCE Token Staking Function.

A staking mechanism requires users who offer compute power or other resources to the service takers in the ecosystem to put up a portion of their tokens in order to do so. If a user has no tokens to stake, but wants to support the network by providing resources they must purchase them. In exchange for staking their tokens and providing the service a financial reward is received. By forcing providers to take a financial risk you are weeding out bad actors.
