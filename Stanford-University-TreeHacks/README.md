## Problem Statement: Cross Blockchain Interoperability of XinFin Network with R3 Corda network.

As a R3 Corda Partner XinFin going to provide bridge to access public state on XinFin Blockchain to R3 consortium of over 200+ financial institutions. We need to Create Bridge between XinFin Network and R3 Corda. This will create the ability to relay R3 Corda a limited set of data and transactions from privacy channels to the XinFin public network.

### At the time of development of bridge keep below mentioned Standard:
a. [ISO20022 Data Standard](https://www.iso20022.org/sites/default/files/documents/general/ISO20022_API_JSON_Whitepaper_Final_20180129.pdf).

b. [ERP data Standard](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/erp/api).

c. [Open Banking Standard](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/16320694/Open+Data+API+Specifications).

d. [SWIFT Data Standard](https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/interfaces-and-integration/swift-apis).

### Corda-XinFin Bridge Functionality

The Relayer Bridge deploys [ Corda Smart ContractState](https://docs.corda.net/api-states.html#api-states) â€”>[Onto]-> XinFin Network Smart Contract State (ContractInstance)

Functionalities are:
- Contract Creation (with function support "isBurnable", "isUpgradeable", "isPausable") and create Transaction Hash
- Atomic Swap (Include Hash of the transaction)
- ContractStatus, Token Transfer Events and Event Logs
- Hide Transactions Details (Needs Pre-compiled contract on EVM)
